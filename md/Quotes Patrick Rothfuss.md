# Quotes by Patrick Rothfuss

---

- Music sounds different to the one who plays it. It is the musician's curse.
- She didn't know any better. Nobody had ever told her she couldn't. Because of this, she moved through the city like some faerie creature. She walked roads no one else could see, and it made her music wild and strange and free.
- Words cannot always do the work we need them to. Music is there for when words fail us.
